# Pipeline Descriptions

You can write descriptions in your pipelines by starting a comment with `#?`.

The lines will be interpreted as markdown.
The first paragraph is the title of the whole pipeline.

Pipelines with a description can be viewed with the `--desc` flag of `kerblam run`.
They also show up in the pipes list with a :scroll:.

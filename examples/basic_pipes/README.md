# Basic pipelines

This example showcases how you can use Kerblam! to manage your pipelines. 

This example has a basic shell pipeline `shell_count` that takes in a text file and 
creates an output file by counting the words in the input file.
It has the same version of it but written as a `makefile`.

Notice how these pipelines are written as if they were executed in the same directory
as the `kerblam.toml` file.

You can also see how `kerblam data clean` preserves the input file `limerick.txt` but deletes
the output file (which can be regenerated by running the pipeline).
